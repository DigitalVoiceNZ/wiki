# Digital Voice DMR

We’re not just another DMR network; we’re a community-driven platform that champions:

* Openness to Innovation: Have a unique idea for a talkgroup? Want to experiment with data modes? Digital Voice DMR provides a welcoming environment for you to try it out.
* Flexibility and Adaptability: Our infrastructure is designed to be nimble, allowing for quicker implementation of new features and protocols.
* A “Try It and See” Mentality: We encourage healthy experimentation, even if it means occasional bumps along the road. Learning and growth are paramount.
* Collaboration and Knowledge Sharing: We envision a vibrant community where users share their discoveries, troubleshoot challenges together, and collectively advance the capabilities of digital communications.
* Digital Voice DMR was born from the desire to embrace the philosphy of experimentation with the desire to run a reliable DMR network.
