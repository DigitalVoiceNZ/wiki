# Welcome to Digital Voice New Zealand

Digital Voice New Zealand started as an XLX reflector - [XLX299](xlx/index.md) - the first New Zealand-based multi-mode reflector, which still remains the heart of DVNZ, supporting D-Star, DMR, and YSF.  Additionally analog bridges provide support for Peanut and Allstar connections.

DVNZ has since expanded its service offerings to include:

* [NZSIP](nzsip/index.md) -  a full Voice over IP telephone service designed for amateur radio operators across Oceania.

* [DVDU DMR](dvdmr/index.md) - we are a founding member of ***Digital Voice Down Under*** a [DMR Network](dvdmr/index.md) collaboration between DVNZ, DVAU, VKRadio and Digital Voice DMR.

* FreeDMR NZ - we host and manage the the New Zealand FreeDMR DMR Master Server.
