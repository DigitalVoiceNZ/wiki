# Welcome to Digital Voice New Zealand

Digital Voice New Zealand started as an XLX reflector - XLX299 - the first New Zealand based multi-mode reflector which still remains the heart of DVNZ supporting D-Star, DMR, YSF, Peanut and Allstar connections.

DVNZ has since expanded it's service offerings to include a full Voice over IP telephone service designed for amateur radio operators across Oceania - [NZSIP](nzsip/index.md)

DVNZ is a founding member of ***Digital Voice Down Under*** a collaboration between DVNZ, DVAU, VKRadio and Digital Voice DMR.
