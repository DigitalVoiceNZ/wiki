Quite awkward. Ok focus back. The DCS reflectors also come with their own network protocol. The protocol here is simply called DCS. Recently the OMs in charge of the DCS decided to drop the system, but some fellow hams decided to take it over.

You are wrong! Continue reading!</p> <p>The software used to run the XLX reflectors actually speaks all three previous protocols REF, XRF, DCS and additionally its own protocol which is only used to interconnect reflectors together. As a side note, XLX reflectors are very versatile and can also be accessed through DMR and Fusion with full audio transcoding. For the sake of clarity this aspect will not be covered here.</p> <p>Back to DStar. The 3 protocols (DCS,XRF,DCS) capability brought lots of confusion and still confuses DStar newbies : some reflector sysops did not do their homework and just hijacked reflector numbers that were used in the legacy XRF and DCS systems. This caused names collision and sometime you did not know if you were really connected to where you wanted to connect.</p> <p>Let\u2019s assume you want to connect to XLX299B. According to the previous examples with REF, XRF and DCS you would expect to have to issue the command XLX299BL from your radio. Unfortunately, this will lead you nowhere. You\u2019ll need to issue either XRF299BL or DCS299BL. Both commands will connect your repeater to XLX299 module B the first one using the DExtra protocol, the other using the DCS protocol. If two repeaters connect to the same reflector module using different protocols the reflector software will convert protocols back and forth i.e. a repeater connected using DExtra will be get the transmissions from the one connected through DCS and vice versa.</p> <p>All credit to Geoffrey Merck (F4FXL)</p>"},{"location":"resources/voip/","title":"An Introduction to the Core Concepts of VoIP","text":""},{"location":"resources/voip/#what-is-voip","title":"What is VoIP?","text":"<p>VoIP, or Voice over Internet Protocol, is a technology that allows you to make voice calls using an internet connection instead of a traditional telephone line. Think of it as a digital version of your phone service. Instead of the sound waves of your voice traveling over a copper wire, they're converted into data packets and sent over the internet, just like an email or a website.</p>"},{"location":"resources/voip/#how-does-voip-work","title":"How Does VoIP Work?","text":"<p>The process of a VoIP call can be broken down into a few simple steps:</p> <ul> <li>Digitization: When you speak into a VoIP phone, your voice is captured by a microphone and converted into a digital signal.</li> <li>Compression: This digital signal is then compressed to reduce the amount of data that needs to be transmitted, making the process more efficient.</li> <li>Packetization: The compressed data is broken down into small units called \"data packets.\" Each packet is assigned a destination address, similar to how a letter has an address.</li> <li>Transmission: These data packets travel across the internet, navigating through various networks and routers to reach their destination. 8 De-packetization and Decompression: Once all the packets arrive at the other end, they are reassembled in the correct order.</li> <li>Conversion: The reassembled data is then converted back into an analog sound signal, which is played through the receiver's speaker, allowing them to hear your voice.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"resources/voip/#key-concepts-and-terminology","title":"Key Concepts and Terminology","text":"<ul> <li>Codec: A codec (coder-decoder) is a piece of software or hardware that compresses and decompresses digital audio. Different codecs offer varying levels of audio quality and require different amounts of bandwidth. Common VoIP codecs include G.711, G.729, and Opus.</li> <li>SIP (Session Initiation Protocol): SIP is the most common signaling protocol used to establish, modify, and terminate VoIP calls. It's the \"language\" that VoIP devices use to communicate with each other, much like HTTP is the language for web browsers and servers.</li> <li>RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol): While SIP sets up the call, RTP is responsible for the actual transmission of the voice data packets during the call. It ensures that the audio is delivered in real-time, in the correct order.</li> <li>Jitter: Jitter refers to the variation in delay between data packets arriving at their destination. High jitter can cause choppy or distorted audio. VoIP systems often use a \"jitter buffer\" to temporarily store packets and smooth out these variations.</li> <li>Latency: Latency is the total delay from the moment a packet is sent until it is received. High latency can cause a noticeable delay in conversation, making it difficult to have a natural-sounding back-and-forth.</li> <li>Bandwidth: Bandwidth is the amount of data that can be transmitted over a network connection in a given amount of time. VoIP calls require a certain amount of bandwidth to maintain good audio quality.</li> <li>PBX (Private Branch Exchange): A PBX is a private telephone network used within a company or organization. A traditional PBX uses physical lines, while a \"hosted\" or \"cloud-based\" PBX uses VoIP technology, eliminating the need for on-site hardware.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"resources/voip/#advantages-of-voip","title":"Advantages of VoIP","text":"<ul> <li>Cost Savings: VoIP calls are often significantly cheaper than traditional phone calls, especially for long-distance and international calls, as they use your existing internet connection.</li> <li>Flexibility and Mobility: VoIP allows you to make and receive calls from anywhere with an internet connection.
