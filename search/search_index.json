You are wrong! Continue reading!</p> <p>The software used to run the XLX reflectors actually speaks all three previous protocols REF, XRF, DCS and additionally its own protocol which is only used to interconnect reflectors together. As a side note, XLX reflectors are very versatile and can also be accessed through DMR and Fusion with full audio transcoding. For the sake of clarity this aspect will not be covered here.</p> <p>Back to DStar. The 3 protocols (DCS,XRF,DCS) capability brought lots of confusion and still confuses DStar newbies : some reflector sysops did not do their homework and just hijacked reflector numbers that were used in the legacy XRF and DCS systems. This caused names collision and sometime you did not know if you were really connected to where you wanted to connect.</p> <p>Let\u2019s assume you want to connect to XLX299B. According to the previous examples with REF, XRF and DCS you would expect to have to issue the command XLX299BL from your radio. Unfortunately, this will lead you nowhere. You\u2019ll need to issue either XRF299BL or DCS299BL. Both commands will connect your repeater to XLX299 module B the first one using the DExtra protocol, the other using the DCS protocol. If two repeaters connect to the same reflector module using different protocols the reflector software will convert protocols back and forth i.e. a repeater connected using DExtra will be get the transmissions from the one connected through DCS and vice versa.</p> <p>All credit to Geoffrey Merck (F4FXL)</p>"}]}
