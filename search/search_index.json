For the sake of clarity this aspect will not be covered here.</p> <p>Back to DStar. The 3 protocols (DCS,XRF,DCS) capability brought lots of confusion and still confuses DStar newbies : some reflector sysops did not do their homework and just hijacked reflector numbers that were used in the legacy XRF and DCS systems. This caused names collision and sometime you did not know if you were really connected to where you wanted to connect.</p> <p>Let\u2019s assume you want to connect to XLX299B. According to the previous examples with REF, XRF and DCS you would expect to have to issue the command XLX299BL from your radio. Unfortunately, this will lead you nowhere. You\u2019ll need to issue either XRF299BL or DCS299BL. Both commands will connect your repeater to XLX299 module B the first one using the DExtra protocol, the other using the DCS protocol. If two repeaters connect to the same reflector module using different protocols the reflector software will convert protocols back and forth i.e. a repeater connected using DExtra will be get the transmissions from the one connected through DCS and vice versa.</p> <p>All credit to Geoffrey Merck (F4FXL)</p>"},{"location":"resources/voip/","title":"An Introduction to the Core Concepts of VoIP","text":""},{"location":"resources/voip/#what-is-voip","title":"What is VoIP?","text":"<p>VoIP, or Voice over Internet Protocol, is a technology that allows you to make voice calls using an internet connection instead of a traditional telephone line.

Different codecs offer varying levels of audio quality and require different amounts of bandwidth. Common VoIP codecs include G.711, G.729, and Opus.</li> <li>SIP (Session Initiation Protocol): SIP is the most common signaling protocol used to establish, modify, and terminate VoIP calls. It's the \"language\" that VoIP devices use to communicate with each other, much like HTTP is the language for web browsers and servers.</li> <li>RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol): While SIP sets up the call, RTP is responsible for the actual transmission of the voice data packets during the call. It ensures that the audio is delivered in real-time, in the correct order.</li> <li>Jitter: Jitter refers to the variation in delay between data packets arriving at their destination. High jitter can cause choppy or distorted audio. VoIP systems often use a \"jitter buffer\" to temporarily store packets and smooth out these variations.</li> <li>Latency: Latency is the total delay from the moment a packet is sent until it is received. High latency can cause a noticeable delay in conversation, making it difficult to have a natural-sounding back-and-forth.</li> <li>Bandwidth: Bandwidth is the amount of data that can be transmitted over a network connection in a given amount of time. VoIP calls require a certain amount of bandwidth to maintain good audio quality.</li> <li>PBX (Private Branch Exchange): A PBX is a private telephone network used within a company or organization.
